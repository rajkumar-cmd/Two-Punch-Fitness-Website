        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Fitness Blender was created by a husband and wife team of personal trainers who felt that there was a lack of reliable health and fitness information on the web. They were frustrated that too many people in the fitness industry were more focused on monetary gain or outward appearance than on good, achievable, long-term health. Now, more than 10 years later, Kelli and Daniel Segars, are still focused on their original goals and approach for the company:</p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachableâ€”for as many people as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Endorse eating unprocessed, whole foods, and working out for a strong, healthy body.</li>
            <li>Encourage a personal, mindful approach to eating and exercise.</li>
            <li>Promote the fact that overall wellness looks different for each individual.</li>
        </ul>
