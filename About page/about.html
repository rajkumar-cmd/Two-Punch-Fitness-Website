    <h2>A little bit about who we are and how it all got started
    </h2>
    <p>Fitness Blender was created by just two people; a husband and wife team of personal
        trainers who thought fitness should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income.
        Both Kelli and Daniel felt like there was a lack of reliable health and fitness
        information on the web, and too many people in the industry were more focused on monetary
        gain or appearance than they were on good health.
